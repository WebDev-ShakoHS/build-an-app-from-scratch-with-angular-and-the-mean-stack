# [Build an App From Scratch With Angular and the MEAN Stack][published url]
## Instructor: [Derek Jensen][instructor url]


Full-stack web development requires coding both a front-end for the browser and back-end server. Using JavaScript for both parts of the app makes life a lot simpler for full-stack devs. That's where the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.js) comes in. With the MEAN technologies, you can code a cutting-edge web app in JavaScript, from the front-end all the way down to the database.

In this course, you'll learn how to use the MEAN technologies to build full-stack web apps using only JavaScript (and its close cousin Typescript). You'll start from absolute scratch, scaffolding an empty project, and build up a complete web app using the MEAN stack. You'll learn how to configure a MongoDB database, how to write a database abstraction layer, and how to create a REST API to make that data available to the front-end. On the client side, you'll learn how to structure an Angular app, how to create a service to connect with the back-end API, and how to implmement each of the UI components that makes a complete app. 

It's easier than you think, so let's get started!
